name: icc-tee
description: >-
  Tee an icc-pipes pipe. Copy what one side writes into a pipe onto the
  same lanes of other pipes, byte for byte, in order, until removed. Plain
  bytes and icc-frames payloads alike come out of every outlet as they
  went in. What the bytes are, and why they are copied, is the caller's
  business.

# icc-tee

A tee is one inlet pipe and N outlet pipes. Every byte SIDE writes into
a lane of the inlet comes out of the same lane of every outlet, in the
order it went in. It is a fitting: it joins pipes that icc-pipes already
made and makes nothing else. Pipes says what a lane is and which lanes
each side writes; see its SKILL.md.

    /tmp/icc-tee-XXXXXXXX/tee    SRC, SIDE, then each DST, one per line
    /tmp/icc-tee-XXXXXXXX/pid    one copier per lane SIDE writes, lane order

## Operations

    scripts/create SRC SIDE DST...  copy what SIDE writes into SRC onto
                                    every DST, print the tee's directory.
                                    Every pipe must exist and have the
                                    same lane count.
    scripts/list                    one line per tee: DIR up|down SRC SIDE DST...
    scripts/remove DIR              stop the tee, delete DIR. The pipes on
                                    either end are left as they were.

SIDE is 0 or 1, as Pipes says: side 0 writes the even lanes, side 1 the
odd ones. To use a tee, write the inlet as SIDE and read each outlet as
the other side. There is nothing else to do.

    a=$(.../icc-pipes/scripts/create 6); b=$(.../icc-pipes/scripts/create 6)
    t=$(scripts/create "$a" 0 "$b")
    .../icc-frames/scripts/write "$a" 0 < photo.jpg
    timeout 5 .../icc-frames/scripts/read "$b" 1 > photo.jpg

## Facts about the tee

Each lane SIDE writes has its own `tee(1)`, that lane of SRC on its
stdin and that lane of every DST as its outputs. These are properties
of that and of the lanes. The skill adds nothing to them.

- A tee copies one direction of one pipe. The lanes the other side
  writes are not touched. Nothing goes back through it.
- The tee is the reader of every lane it copies. Bytes it takes are
  gone from SRC and exist only on the outlets. Read the outlets.
- Every lane is copied whole, in order, onto the same lane number, and
  every pipe has the same lane count. That is all icc-frames' rule
  needs, so a Frames read on any outlet yields the payload.
- The tee is one more writer on each outlet lane. Everything Pipes says
  of a writer holds for it.
- Each chunk read from a lane is written to that lane of every outlet,
  in order, before the next chunk is read. An outlet lane that is full
  and not being drained stalls its copier, so the same lane of every
  other outlet, and of SRC once it fills, stalls behind it. Nothing is
  kept.
- What a write into SRC can leave on the wire and walk away from is
  SRC's lanes plus, while the copiers can move, the outlets' lanes.
  Pipes' SKILL.md has the numbers.
- A copier ends when its lane of SRC hits EOF or a write to an outlet
  lane fails. Held lanes never do either, so the tee runs until removed
  or until a pipe on either end is removed. Then list says down. remove
  it and create it again.
- The outlet lanes are in each copier's argv; the inlet lane is not.
  `pkill -f` on a DST path finds the tee. On the SRC path it finds
  nothing.

## In Claude Code

Every Bash call is a fresh shell. The copiers are their own processes,
so the tee outlives calls. Seats in one session share the container and
its /tmp; sessions do not, so no tee crosses that line.
